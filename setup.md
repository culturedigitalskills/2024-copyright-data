## Data Sets
This tutorial will require access to
various examples of media files to practice
some of the learning done during the session.

If you are doing this lesson as part
of a workshop which creates datasets, you can
reuse what you have collected before.

Otherwise, you can use example data sets from sites such as:

- [Europeana](https://www.europeana.eu/en)
- [Open Educational Resources](https://oercommons.org/)


This resource is built with [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/), as part of the training activities of the [AHRC-funded network service on Digital Skills in Visual and Material Culture](https://www.culturedigitalskills.org).
