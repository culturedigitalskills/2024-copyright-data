- Demonstrate the implications of copyrights
for using data within projects, and how to license according to copyright.

It is important to reference creative works.

There are [best practices](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/best_practices_for_attribution) when attributing works
in order to recognise:

- **Title** of the work;
- **Copyright** owner;
- **Source** of the work;
- **License** under which you use the work.

For example:

["Still Life with Ham"](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pieter_Claesz,_Opstilling_med_skinke,_1625,_0234NMK,_Nivaagaards_Malerisamling.png) by Pieter Claesz licensed under CC0

::::::: challenge

For the data files you have curated, determine the
copyright owner, and whether you are allowed to use the content
for educational, non-commercial or commercial purposes.

Determine how to attribute the creative works.

Use this [license chooser](https://chooser-beta.creativecommons.org/) from the Creative Commons to define the license you need.
